hidden プロパティとprotected プロパティは微妙に異なります。

- `hidden` determines whether a property is returned by a query directly against the model that contains the property.
- `protected` determines whether a property is returned by a query against a model that has a relation to the model being queried.

Hidden and protected properties are subtly different.

- `hidden` determines whether a property is returned by a query directly against the model that contains the property.
- `protected` determines whether a property is returned by a query against a model that has a relation to the model being queried.
